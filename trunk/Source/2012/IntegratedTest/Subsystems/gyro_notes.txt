Custom gyro is the same as WPILib gyro, w/two changes:

- 	static const float kDefaultVoltsPerDegreePerSecond = 0.0125;
     
    [in WPILib version, it's 0.007]
    
-   GetAngle() was changed to not report a value < -360 or > 360

    [in WPILib version, value can be outside these ranges, as it
     wraps]
