FilteredAccelerometer differs from WPILib version Accelerometer in 
only one way:
This code is added to the end of the InitAccelerometer() method:
	// Set the averaging total to larger than the default;
	// this is to overcome the nois signal from the accelerometer
	// when the default averaging window width is used.
	m_analogChannel->SetAverageBits(10);
